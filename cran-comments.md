## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION title to title case.

* Right spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    differents (9:111) -> different
    serie (9:145) -> series
    shareable (8:66) -> this word has been deleted 
    
* Prevented the Description field to start with the package name 

## Test environments
* OS X (on travis-ci), R-oldrel, R-release
* linux (on travis-ci), R-oldrel, R-release
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs
