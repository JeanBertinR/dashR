library(dashR)
```


With dashR, you can compare your favorite regression models issued from H2O or Spark frameworks without any effort.

## Getting started

This is a basic example which shows you how to run the app:

```{r example, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width=600, out.height=400}

library(dashR)
longley2 <- longley %>% mutate(Year = as.Date(as.character(Year),format = "%Y"))
dash_spark(data =longley2,x = c("GNP_deflator","Unemployed" ,"Armed_Forces","Employed"),y = "GNP",date_column = "Year",share_app = TRUE,port = 3951)
```
